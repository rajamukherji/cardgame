## Gameplay

At any stage, the **deck** is divided into 3 lists of cards
* The **draw pile** (shown as _Backlog_)
* The **hand** (shown as _In Progress_)
* The **discard pile** (shown as _Completed_)

There are a number of **counters**
* **Time** - resets at the start of each turn
* **Influence** - can be used to remove agile **overhead**, hire **developers**, etc
* **Value** - main target of the game, to reach certain targets or generate as much **value** as possible

There can be any number of **modifiers**, each affecting one or more card types (including all types)
* Increase / decrease cost
* Increase / decrease requirement
* Block play
* Change outcome (**effects**) generated by card

Each card can create any number of **effects** by playing
* Increase / decrease any number of **counters**
* Create a new card, added to the **draw pile**, **hand** or **discard pile**
* Remove a card from the **draw pile**, **hand** or **discard pile**
* Move a card between **draw pile**, **hand** and **discard pile**

Each card has the following attributes

* Name / Description
* drawn(Reason) - called when card is added to the **hand**
* playable() - called to determine if a card can be played
* play() - called when a player _tries_ to play the card
* discard(Reason) - called when a card is moved from the **hand** to the **discard pile** without playing
* remove(Reason) - called when a card is removed from the **deck**
